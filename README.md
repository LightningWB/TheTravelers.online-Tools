# TheTravelers.online-Tools
Useful tools for thetravelers.online currently including auto xp, auto double step, auto mine, auto travel, tree mower and auto reconnect.
# Installation
Paste the contents of main.js into the console, install the extension which is what I recommend, or use the bookmarklet after logged into the travelers.online and the tools will show up. (Bookmarklets appear to be broken in firefox currently so you have to paste the code in or the extensions)
### Console
1.   Either do ctrl-j or ctrl-shift-i and go to console.
2.   Paste all of main.js into the console and press enter.
3.   Done.

2.   Navigate to your browsers addon installation area. Here are the popular ones.

3.   Either do load unpacked or load temporary addon and select the manifest.json on Firefox or the extension folder on edge and chrome.
4.   Now when you go to thetravelers.online the client will be there.
