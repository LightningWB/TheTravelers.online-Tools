# TheTravelers.online-Tools
Useful tools for thetravelers.online currently including auto xp, auto double step, auto mine, auto travel, tree mower and auto reconnect.
# Instaliation
Paste the contents of main.js into the console, install the extension which is what I recommend, or use the bookmarklet after logged into the travelers.online and the tools will show up. (Bookmarklets appear to be broken in firefox currently so you have to paste the code in or the extensions)
### Console
1.   Either do ctrl-j or ctrl-shift-i and go to console.
2.   Paste all of main.js into the console and press enter.
3.   Done.
### Extension
1.   To setup the extension first download the extension folder.
2.   Navigate to your browsers addon instalation area. Here are the popular ones.
  - Chrome: chrome://extensions/
  - Firefox: about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
  - Edge: edge://extensions/
3.   Either do load unpacked or load temporary addon and select the manifest.json on Firefox or the extension folder on edge and chrome.
4.   Now when you go to thetravelers.online the client will be there.
### Bookmarklet
1.   To setup the bookmarklet right click on the bookmark bar and click either add page or new bookmark depending on your browser.
2.   Set the name to anything you want
3.   Set the url or location to the contents of bookmarklet.txt
4.   Select save
